# Big O Notation

A Big O Notation is a way of judging effeciency of an Algorithm. Big O is represented by 
O(n) or O(1) and mnay more

O(1) means Time to execute an Algorithm does not depend on the size of input (n).
O(n)
O(n^2)
O(n^3)
O(log n)
O(n log n)
and many more.

## Types of Asymptotic Notations

2. Big Theta 

3. Big Omega
