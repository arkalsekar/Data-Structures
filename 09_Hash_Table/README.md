# Hash Table
Hashing Techniques are used to store keys into Hash Tables.
A Large Domain of key values are mapped to relatively smaller domain of hash tables.

Hash Tables are  
* Linear Data Structures
* Hash Function are used to Calculate the address (location) in the hash table
* Hence the Insertion and Searching Takes constant time complexity ie Big O (1)

## Basic Functioning of Hashing and Hash Tables
There are some basic procedures that are to be followed for Insertion

1. Push: Add an element to the top of a stack. Time Complexity Big O(1).
2. Pop: Remove an element from the top of a stack.  Time Complexity Big O(1).
3. IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty. Time Complexity Big O(1).
4. IsFull: Check if the stack is full. Time Complexity Big O(1).
5. Peek: Get the value of the top element without removing it. Time Complexity Big O (n).

## Applications of a Stack
1. Call Stack used by Compilers of Languages like C / Javascript and etc.
2. Parenthesis Matching
3. Infix to Postfix

## Different Hashing Techniques
1. Direct Hashing
2. Subtraction 
3. Mid Square Method
4. Digit Extraction 
5. Modulo-Remainder
6. Folding
7. Shifting
8. Rotation
9. Pseudo-Random Method

However, all the methods have a problem of collision and hence we require collision resolution techniques

## Collision Resolution Techniques
Collision are the basic problems of almost all the hashing algorithms, hence we required techniques and method for their resolution
1. Closed Hashing / Open Addressing 
    * Linear Probing
    * Quadratic Probing
    * Double Hashing 

2. Open Hashing / Closed Addressing
    * Seperate Chaining
