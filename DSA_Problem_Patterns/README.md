# DSA Problem Patterns
Here are some of the Patterns observed in Solving DSA Problems.

1. Sliding Window
This algorithmic technique is used when we need to handle the input data in a specific window size.

2. Islands (Matrix Traversal)
This pattern describes all the efficient ways of traversing a matrix (or 2D array).

3. Two Pointer Approach
Two pointer are initited and are executed over a linked list or array.

4. Fast and Slow Pointer (Hare and Tortoise Algorithm)
It is also known as Hare and Tortoise Algorithm. It is used in Detecting cycles in a Linked List.

5. Merge Intervals 
This technique is used to deal with overlapping intervals.


6. Cyclic Sort
Use this technique to solve array problems where the input data lies within a fixed range.

7. In Place Reversal of a Linked List
This technique describes an efficient way to reverse the links between a set of nodes of a LinkedList. Often, the constraint is that we need to do this in-place, i.e., using the existing node objects and without using extra memory.

8. Breath First Search 
This technique is used to solve problems involving traversing trees or graphs in a breadth-first search manner.

9. Depth First Search 
This technique is used to solve problems involving traversing trees or graphs in a depth-first search manner.

10. Two Heaps
In many problems, we are given a set of elements that can be divided into two parts. We are interested in knowing the smallest element
in one part and the biggest element in the other part. As the name suggests, this technique uses a Min-Heap to find the smallest element and a Max-Heap to find the biggest element

11. Subsets
Use this technique when the problem asks to deal with permutations or combinations of a set of elements.

12. Modified Binary Search 
Use this technique to search a sorted set of elements efficiently. 

13. Top K elements
This technique is used to find top/smallest/frequently occurring ‘K’ elements in a set.

15. 0/1 Knapsack 
This technique is used to solve optimization problems. Use this technique to select elements that give maximum profit from a given set with a limitation on capacity and that each element can only be picked once. 

16. Longest Common Substring
Use this technique to find the optimal part of a string/sequence or set of strings/sequences.
