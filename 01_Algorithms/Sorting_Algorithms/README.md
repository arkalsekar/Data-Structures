# Sorting Algorithms in C

## Types of Sorting Algorithms in C
1. Bubble Sort
1st  Loop For Passes;
Starts from i = 0; to i < n -1;

2nd Loop For Setting the Largest Number; 								
Starts from j = i; j < n -1; 

if arr[j] is greater than arr[j + 1]
So Swap arr[j] to arr[j + 1].

2. Insertion Sort
