# Searching Algorithms

## Types of Searching Algorithms

1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search
 
## Linear Search
Start with index 0 and compare each element with the target.
If the target is found to be equal to the element, return its index.
If the target is not found, return -1


## Binary Search
This type of searching algorithm is used to find the position of a specific value contained in a sorted array. The binary search algorithm works on the principle of divide and conquer and it is considered the best searching algorithm because it's faster to run.


## Other Searching Algorithms

1. Jump Search
2. Interpolation Search
3. Exponential Search
4. Sublist Search (Search a linked list in another list)
5. Fibonacci Search
6. The Ubiquitous Binary Search
